# GeneticWithUnity
in this project, we try to implement genetic algorithms to illustrate the evolution process of evolving a car to its best match for the environment (a car which can travel more distance)
in this phase, it is using genetic algorithm but we are trying to implement other algorithms like FOE to evaluate results.

## Demo
This is just a demo of our progress till now but now we are trying to implement both algorithms on a truck which is responsible to transmit a number of boxes from point A to point B
